# Math_183_HW_1
## Description
The file `graph.py` contains all of the code to create the graphs for assignment 1. It uses the [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library. You can either install it directly on the website or doing `pip install pandas` and `pip install seaborn`. 

## Notice:
The file paths to the obesity and student data csv files will not work since the path used was the path on my local computer. You must change the file path to the correct path for it to work. 

Each problem has been commented out. To get the desired graph uncomment the corresponding section of code which is labeled with the question part.
